          <p>Our refund policy at EcomBrandBuilder is very simple.</p>
          <p>
            If ask for a refund within 30 minutes of ordering, we will happily
            issue you a full refund. The reason the refund window is so small is
            because we begin working on your services right away to have them
            delivered within 3-7 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a order is created, there are no refunds. All services created
            and delivered to clients of ecombrandbuilder.com are nonrefundable
            because there is no way for us to recoup our costs once we have
            created the services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though we have a strict refund policy, we also offer revisions
            within 24 hours after a service is delivered. We always want to make
            sure our clients are happy with the end result of their service.
          </p>
          <p>
            For any questions related to refunds, email
            contact@ecombrandbuilder.com
          </p>
          <p>We look forward to serving you as a client!</p>{" "}
